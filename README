This project is to explore the use of structs and pointers
to make a set of fuctions for complex-number calculations.

The intended functionality will include (at least) :

Enter one, or two complex numbers
Calculate and display:
	
	Sum of 2 complex numbers - done
	Difference of 2 complex numbers - done
	Multiplication of 2 complex numbers - done
	Division of 2 complex numbers - done
	Inverse of 1 complex number - done


		Dot product
		Cross product

	Complex Conjugate of 1 complex number
	Inverse of 1 complex number

	Rectangular -> Polar conversion
	Polar -> Rectangular conversion

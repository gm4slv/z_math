This project is to explore the use of structs and pointers
to make a set of fuctions for complex-number calculations.

There are much simpler ways to calculate complex arithmetic
but this project is intended as a way of exploring the use
of structs and pointers, with the complex numbers just being
a suitable thing to use as a struct and the various
functions require struct pointers to be passed in and out

It's a learning curve.....



The intended functionality will include (at least) :

Enter one, or two complex numbers
Calculate and display:
	
	Sum of 2 complex numbers 			- done
	Difference of 2 complex numbers 	- done
	Multiplication of 2 complex numbers - done
	Division of 2 complex numbers 		- done
	Inverse of 1 complex number 		- done
	Inverse of 1 complex number 		- done
	Rectangular -> Polar conversion 	- done 
	Polar -> Rectangular conversion 	- done 
	Dot product							- done
	Cross product						- done
	Complex Conjugate					- done
	Unit Vector							- done

<TO DO LIST>
	
	
To think about in future:

Storage of caclulation results to use in next calculation
	- a simple stack - would a linked list be an approach to this?

This project is to explore the use of structs and pointers
to make a set of fuctions for complex-number calculations.

The intended functionality will include (at least) :

Enter one, or two complex numbers
Calculate and display:
	
	Sum of 2 complex numbers 			- done
	Difference of 2 complex numbers 	- done
	Multiplication of 2 complex numbers - done
	Division of 2 complex numbers 		- done
	Inverse of 1 complex number 		- done
	Inverse of 1 complex number 		- done

	Rectangular -> Polar conversion 	- done
	Polar -> Rectangular conversion 	- done

<TO DO LIST>

		Dot product
		Cross product
		Complex Conjugate of 1 complex number
	
To think about in future:

Storage of caclulation results to use in next calculation
	- a simple stack - would a linked list be an approach to this?
